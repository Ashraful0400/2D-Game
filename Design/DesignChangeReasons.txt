 - Removed stages due to time constraints (replaced with 1 GamePanel)
 - Pulled out all entitity-spawning responsibilities from GamePanel to Spawner due to the GamePanel becoming unneccessarily long
 - Pulled out responsibility of announcing game is over from classes to GamePanel to minimize number of classes directly announcing game is over
 - Changed from float positions to integer positions taking account that they would now be based in pixels
 - Added moveAgain() method to MovableEnemy to move it again once hitting a barrier
